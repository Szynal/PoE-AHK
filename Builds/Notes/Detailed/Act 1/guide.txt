Common tips for FAST leveling:
> Try not to TP to Town at all (saves time and scrolls)
this guide will tell you when it is really needed
< Each time you're in town, take rewards and check what vendors sells
While in Act1, check vendors for boots with + speed
type "nn" in filter to find them
in Act 2 if still don't have them, just bench craft it
> Always make spells "attack without moving"
do not try to kill all mobs in a zone
Don't use body armor, it slows your character a bit
